            <div> Harbour has one of the highest and fastest growth
                rates in Jamaica and is projected to remain so in the
                future. The population increased from 17,966 in 1991
                to 29,835 in 2005. The population of Old Harbour iss
                growing steadily and spilling over into Old Harbour
                Bay. (Source: Planning Institute of Jamaica, 2009). Data gathered shows that approximately 66.9 per cent of
                the residents of Old Harbour were born in St. Catherine.
                Migration is quite uncommon in the community, as
                88.6 per cent have lived in the community for 10 or
                more years. St. Catherine, which lies west of St. Andrews and south
                of St. Mary and St. Ann, is the largest parish on the
                island with an area of 1,260 km², and a population
                of 383,317 (2001 Population Census). A four-lane
                highway connects Spanish Town with Kingston, the
                nation’s capital. On the southern road from Spanish
                Town is the town of Old Harbour which has a
                population of 17,883. On the coast, five kilometres
                from Old Harbour is Old Harbour Bay, the largest
                fishing village in Jamaica. It has a fine harbour with one
                of the best deep-water piers on the island. The main
                generating power plant of the Jamaica Public Service is
                in Old Harbour Bay. The plains of St. Catherine, which provide numerous
                grazing pens, are largely used up for sugar and rice
                cultivation. The Rio Cobre Canal irrigates about
                7,200 hectares of the St. Catherine Plains. The Bodles
                Agricultural Station lies between Old Harbour and
                May Pen. The Soya Bean Processing Plant is between
                Old Harbour and May Pen. (Source: Geography and
                History of Jamaica. Published by The Jamaica Gleaner).
                With the agricultural collapse in the agricultural sector,
                there is evidence of a strong rural – urban migration.
                The planning and land management authorities in the
                urban centres will have to cope with this population
                influx by improving the provision of services such as
                housing, education and health services</div>
